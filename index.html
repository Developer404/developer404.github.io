                        Take the knowledge you need. Use it. Share it. And move on to the next. <br> <br>
                        Many books would be great blog posts but instead got dragged out into a whole book. <br> <br>
                        They probably started out that way. Then someone came along and said, ‘Hey we should turn these 1200 words into 60000 and sell it for more.’ <br> <br>
                            
                        I grew up with the internet so my attention span is fleeting. <br> <br>
                            
                        I’ve got about 3-4 hours a day of deep work time. No where near enough to read all the books I want and work on the things I want to. <br> <br>
                            
                        This morning, I’m reading The Unpublished David Ogilvy. Its brevity makes it a page turner. <br> <br>

                        And if you’re a writer, remember, less but better. This is more so a note to self. Kick my ass if I don’t. <br> <br>

                        <h3>Want me to write about something? </h3>
